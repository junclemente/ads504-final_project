## Environment Setup

This project uses a conda environment specified in a YAML file for
reproducibility and consistent development. Ensure you have
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) or
[Miniconda](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/main)
installed.

```{bash}
conda env create -f environment/ads504_project.yml
```

#### Update the Environment (if needed)

If there are any updates to the environment, you can update the environment
